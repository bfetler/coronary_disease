## Coronary Heart Disease
How well can we predict coronary heart disease from patient data?  An early dataset is given in the [UCI Machine Learning Heart Disease Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).  

Data was collected from 303 patients, both without and with varying degrees of coronary heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic.  Since there are so few data points, patients with heart disease were grouped together for a binary target variable.  Some of the seventy-five columns of original data were corrupted, and replaced with fourteen columns by the data author.  After data cleaning, 297 patients were left.  Despite the small size, it is a reasonable dataset to start exploring coronary disease prediction.
